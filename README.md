# pproj

Disregard the python file 'gamez'. Eventually what I will do is hook up python flask with my javascript code so that this mouse game will work. What does work (if you have the 'node_modules' files in this folder (see 'https://nodejs.org/en/' on how to install those files)), is if you go to this folder and run the command 'npm start' in gitbash. A local server will be setup and will run the javascript program automatically. The game is not perfect. But I'm detirmined to finish it.
